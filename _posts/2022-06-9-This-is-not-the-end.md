title: 'This is Not the End'
---


Do you want to hear about how Arya sent Blade a birthday gift via quantum teleportation, how councilcat Poh tricked Arya out of laying claim to a cardbox box, and other stories about the townscats of Whiskerton?


The good news is the stories don't end here, this is only the beginning. 


This is the Beta release of *Quantum Kittens*; we are slowly and steadily working towards completing the book! This book is also part of Radha's experimentation with creative approaches to education, such as game-based learning and learning through storytelling. (Want to know more about game-based learning and IBM Quantum's foray into this space through the program Radha leads?
